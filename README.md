**Key Displayed Metrics:** The dashboard prominently displays several key performance indicators (KPIs) that help in better understanding and analyzing the car accident data. These KPIs may include:

* Percentage of safe driving vehicles
* Percentage of accident rates
* A timeline bar for filtering records by specific months or years

**Real-time Data:** The dashboard offers real-time data updates, ensuring that the analysis remains up-to-date and relevant for decision-makers.

**Data Analysis:** The project's primary goal is to provide data-driven insights into car accidents and the factors associated with them. This analysis can inform strategies for improving road safety.

**Granular Analysis:** By including information such as road surface type, location, vehicle type, and more, the project allows for granular analysis. This can help identify trends and patterns that contribute to accidents.

**Time-Based Analysis:** The ability to filter data by month or year allows for time-based analysis, helping to identify seasonal trends or changes in accident rates over time.

**Safety Improvement:** The project may support efforts to enhance road safety by identifying areas where accidents are most frequent and suggesting interventions to reduce accidents.

**Data-Driven Decision Making:** By presenting critical data in an easily digestible format, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making for stakeholders involved in road safety initiatives.

**Continuous Monitoring:** The real-time aspect of the dashboard enables continuous monitoring of safety metrics and accident rates, allowing for prompt responses to emerging trends or issues.

**User-Friendly:** The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible to a wide range of users, including those who may not have advanced data analysis skills.

**Conclusion:** Overall, the "Car Accident Data Analysis" project leverages data visualization techniques in Microsoft Excel to provide valuable insights into car accidents and vehicle-related factors. It serves as a valuable tool for stakeholders working to improve road safety and make informed decisions based on real-time data.
